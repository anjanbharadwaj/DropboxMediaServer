This project was created and open-sourced by Anjan Bharadwaj to serve as a personal Dropbox! 
Designed to run constantly on a computer (in my case, I run it on my Raspberry
Pi), it allows users to create a home media server in which they can quickly
retrieve and push files. All files are stored in a "dropbox" folder on the 
Raspberry Pi. 

Various tools that are used include:
Flask and Python
Ngrok (to expose the computer's localhost)
Javascript, HTML, CSS (Landing page with simple UI for users to retrieve files)

Feel free to download the project for yourself!
