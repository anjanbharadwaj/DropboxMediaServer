This project was created and open-sourced by Anjan Bharadwaj to serve as a personal Dropbox! 
Designed to run constantly on a computer (in my case, I run it on my Raspberry
Pi), it allows users to create a home media server in which they can quickly
retrieve and push files. All files are stored in a "dropbox" folder on the 
Raspberry Pi. However, even if you aren't using it specifically for a Dropbox, the code provided is essentially an API for retrieving and storing information on a computer (thus, it can be used in many cases for your project)

Various tools that are used include:
Flask and Python
Ngrok (to expose the computer's localhost)
Javascript, HTML, CSS (Landing page with simple UI for users to retrieve files)

Feel free to download the project for yourself! However, I request you don't use the project for commercial use without consulting with me first.
